        question:"•	Why is carbon bad for the environment?",
        answer: "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a heat-trapping gas, or greenhouse gas, whose presence in the atmosphere leads to warmer temperatures on Earth. CO2 is produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Since the beginning of industrial times, roughly 200 years ago, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 50%, leading to rising global temperatures and increasingly frequent climate disasters. To prevent further irreparable damage to our planet and its living things, we need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and replace fossil fuels in our economy with sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives.",

        question:"•	What is carbon capture?",
        answer: "Carbon capture is a process by which CO2 emissions are captured before (point source capture) or after they are released into the atmosphere (direct air capture). Point-source capture is typically done at power plants and industrial facilities that emit large amounts of CO2, such as those that burn fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. Direct air capture involves using fans to circulate ambient air through a solution to remove the CO2 that has already been emitted. The CO2 is then transported and stored in geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, and un-mineable coal seams.",

        question:"•	What is carbon conversion?",
        answer: "Carbon conversion or transformation refers to the process of upgrading captured CO2 into usable products for industry. From an end-to-end perspective, carbon capture and conversion refer to a circular approach of upcycling carbon waste into usable products, thus alleviating the need for new sources of carbon (a.k.a. fossil fuels).",

        question:"•	Is this actually good for the world?",
        answer: "Renewable methanol has several positive impacts on the environment, although there are several considerations that require careful attention. Renewable methanol has significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels when made with renewable resources and captured CO2. Also, our methanol is produced locally, creating jobs and enhancing energy security. As aviation, shipping, and chemicals require hydrocarbon fuels to operate, our renewable methanol will provide a clean and sustainable way to keep their operations running smoothly.",

        question:"•	How is methanol used?",
        answer: "Fuel for Aviation: Methanol-to-Jet is an established pathway for creating jet fuel from methanol. When renewable methanol is used, there are substantial reductions in the lifecycle carbon emissions. Fuel for Shipping: Several of the biggest maritime companies in the world have made tens of billions of dollars of investments into ships that can run on renewable methanol. These ships will be able to accept our methanol directly from our reactors. Fuel: Methanol is a clean-burning fuel that can be used as a substitute for gasoline in internal combustion engines. It is also used as a fuel in some industrial and residential heating systems. Solvent: Methanol is a commonly used solvent for a variety of chemical reactions and for dissolving a wide range of substances, including resins and dyes. Chemical feedstock: Methanol is an important feedstock to produce several chemicals, including formaldehyde, acetic acid, and formic acid. Antifreeze: Methanol is used as an antifreeze in the radiator coolant of some vehicles and in industrial and residential heating systems. Disinfectant: Methanol is a commonly used disinfectant and is used to sterilize laboratory equipment, medical instruments, and surfaces. Fuel cell applications: Methanol is used as a fuel in fuel cell systems, where it is converted into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen.",
